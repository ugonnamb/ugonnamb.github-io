  <h2>Many people have different ways to do makeup and I have mine.  If you are ready to see my ways please stay and if not just go away :)</h2>
  <h3> First things first eyebrows are <strong>SISTERS</strong> not <strong>TWINS</strong>!</h3>
  <h3> If you are trying that hard to make your eyebrows looks just alike then good luck because you'll be trying for hours, just saying. One may look different from the other but that is totally ok all that matters is that it looks really good!</h3>

  <h3> In my opinion I don't really like when eyebrows start so harsh in the front, creating a box shape. Just to not get that box shape look you need to lightly fill in the front creating tiny soft hair strokes in the beginning of the brow to make it look realistic.</h3>
